# [NE-library](https://github.com/WisTiCeJEnT/ne-library)
My frequent function I wrote by my own.

NEmath.py
```python
def plist(n) #Prime list
    #Create list of prime numbers from 2 to N
    return primelist

def gcd(a,b) #Greatest common divisor
    return #GCD of A&B
```
conv.py
```python
def intStr(n) #number in int or string  ex: 1
    return #that number in string       ex: "one"
```
